# Performance analysis of greedy, backtracking and welsh powell algorithms
Through this project we have implemented the graph coloring problem using the Greedy algorithm,the
Backtracking algorithm and the Welsh Powell algorithm and then to determine which of these provides 
us with the best performance,we get a comparitive analysis on basis of their runtimes through data analysis.
